Welcome to my personal blog made for my internship in CRA-W.

I'm a student from _Bordeaux Sciences Agro_ and I'm doing an internship in the Walloon agricultural centre of research. I participate in the AGROMET project which aims to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters at the resolution of 1 kmÂ² for the whole region of Wallonia characterized by a quality indicator.
